Introduction
===========


SwipeLayout, you can put two child views inside it, the first child is content view, the other is action view. 
Content view is the default view, action view will show only when you are swiping the layout.


Modification
=======

This fork use the SwipeLayout as the template to fulfil a simple listview. I want to use this demo as a example to illustrate how to blind the same kind of button in various raws with corresponding function and work well simultaneously. I also struggle to separate the ItemAdapter with MainActivity and ensure basic list item can be updated(added, removed and so forth) automatically.
